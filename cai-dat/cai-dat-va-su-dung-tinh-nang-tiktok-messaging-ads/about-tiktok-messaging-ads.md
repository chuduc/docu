# About TikTok Messaging Ads

### 1. What is TikTok Messaging Ads

[TikTok Messaging Ads](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/about-tiktok-messaging-ads?aadvid=7096064798990893058) allow prospective customers to start conversations with businesses through TikTok Direct Messages and Instant Messaging Apps.\
With Direct Messaging Ads, users are kept in the TikTok app, and directed to TikTok's direct messaging feature to start chatting with advertisers.\
With Instant Messaging Ads, users are redirected outside of TikTok to the third-party messaging app, such as Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, to start chatting with advertisers.

TikTok Messaging Ads are a good solution for advertisers looking to:

* Reach new customers: Tap into a new audience and meet new customers by leveraging the power of TikTok's vibrant community.
